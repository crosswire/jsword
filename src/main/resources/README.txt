This iso639_all.txt is generated from:
	http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/iso-639-3_YYYYMMDD.tab
and
	http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/iso-639-3_Name_Index_YYYYMMDD.tab

Convert it from UTF-8 to Java's ASCII representation with:
	native2ascii

The catalog iso639 changes content and format frequently.
Change the code below and rebuild the file as the need arises.

The iso639*.properties files are kept with a pruned set of names
for the languages found in the SWORD catalog of Books
and those names found at www.crosswire.org/wiki.

iso639.properties uses localized names, where known, and is sync'd SWORD's locales.d/locales.conf
iso639_en.properties has the English name, date ranges in brackets [...] and localized name suffixed in ()

This is primarily for performance, but it is also to facilitate translation.

Using:
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use Unicode::Normalize;
binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

my $date = "20130123";
my %names = ();
my %codes = ();
open(my $nameIndexFile, "<:utf8", "iso-639-3_Name_Index_$date.tab");
# skip the first line
my $firstLine = <$nameIndexFile>;
while (<$nameIndexFile>)
{
	# chomp ms-dos line endings
	s/\r//o;
	chomp();
	# Skip blank lines
	next if (/^$/o);
	# ensure it is normalized to NFC
	$_ = NFC($_);
	my @line = split(/\t/o, $_);
	$names{$line[0],$line[1]} = $line[2];
}
