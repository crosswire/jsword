/**
 * VersificationMapper maps a Verse or a Passage in one Versification (v11n)
 * to another, using the KJV v11n as an intermediary.
 * <p>
 * Practically speaking, a Verse in one v11n may map:
 * <ul>
 * <li>to the same verse in another v11n. This is the typical case.</li>
 * <li>to another verse in the same chapter. This is common and typically by one, shifting following verses.</li>
 * <li>to another verse in a different chapter. This is fairly common.</li>
 * <li>to two other verses. This is common in the Psalms and a few places elsewhere.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The internal details of the mapping can be found in VersificationToKJVMapper.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This transitive relationship is not perfect. It assumes that verses
 * outside of the KJV versification map 1:1 between the source and
 * target Versifications. That it uses the KJV as an intermediary is an
 * implementation detail that may change. Do not rely on it.
