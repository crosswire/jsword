/**
 * The Project class looks after the source of project files. These are per user

 * <td>~/Library/Application Support/JSword</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Win NT/2000/XP/ME/9x</td>

 * Previously the location was ~/.jsword, which is unfriendly in the Windows and

 * Note: If the Java System property jsword.home is set and it exists and is
