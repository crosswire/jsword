/**
 * This package looks after Exceptions and messages as they happen. It would be
 * nice not to need this class - the principle being that any library that
 * encounters an error can throw an exception to indicate that there is a
 * problem. However this is not always the case. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>static class constructors should not throw, unless the class really is of
 * no use given the error, and yet we may want to tell the user that there was a
 * (non-critical) error.</li>
 * <li>Any library routine that works in a loop, applying some (potentially
 * failing) functionality, may want to continue the work without throwing in
 * response to a single error.</li>
 * <li>The class being implemented may implement an interface that disallows
 * nested exceptions and yet does not want to loose the root cause error
 * information. (This is the weakest of the above arguments, but probably still
 * valid.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * However in many of the times this class is used, this is the
 * reason:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Within UI specific code - to throw up a dialog box (or whatever). Now
 * this use is currently tolerated, however it is probably a poor idea to use
 * GUI agnostic messaging in a GUI specific context. But I'm not bothered enough
 * to change it now. Specifically this use is deprecated because it makes the
 * app more susceptible to the configuration of the things that listen to
 * reports.</li>
 * </ul>
