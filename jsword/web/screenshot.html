<h1>Screenshots</h1>

<p>The opening screen. We've just done a search for &quot;aaron&quot;, the verse-list
  shows-up in the view edit-box (which is editable) along with a display of the
  matching passages. Since there were more matches than would fit on a single
  page there are a number of tabs (along the bottom) that show successive parts
  of the search. This helps speed things up if there are a large number of matches
  to a search.</p>

<p>Another search, returning less matches this time, and we have turned the list
  on. This gives you a list of matches, selecting from the list filters the passages
  shown in the main window on the right.</p>

<p>From the list menu we select &quot;Blur by 1 verse&quot;, which gives you
  an extra verse of context around each verse that you can see. The views have
  automatically merged the passages that now overlap. So in the last picture
  where Mat 1:16, 18, 20 all match, after we blur by 1 verse we would get Mat
  1:15-17, and Mat 1:17-19 and Mat 1:19-21, which is the same as Mat 1:15-21.</p>

<p>We can just type a passage to view in the view area. If the passage is too
  large to fit then we get the bottom tabs as before. JSword will do a good job
  of working out what you want to see from what you type in the view area.</p>

<p>For when you want to do a more in-depth study, perhaps doing a search and
  then investigating the matches in more detail there is a tabbed mode that lets
  to keep the results of a number of searches. The tabs are given names to match
  what you are doing in that view.</p>

<p>Or if you don't like tabbed mode there is also a windowed that will let you
  see several passages at the same time. Generally speaking you'd want the window
  a little bigger than we have it here to make the most of this mode!</p>
