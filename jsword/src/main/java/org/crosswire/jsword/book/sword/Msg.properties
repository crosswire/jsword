# Where ClassName is the name of the class using the property.
# When the resource is used by more than one class it should be the one
# that the resource is most closely associated.
# The MessageName should be mixed case, with a leading capital.
# It should have no spaces or other punctuation (e.g. _, -, ', ...)
