<p>The core responsibility of the passage package is to 
store and collate information about the structure of the Bible - The most 
important classes are <code>Passage</code>, <code>PassageTally</code> and <code>Strongs</code>. A <code>Passage</code> stores lists of 
verses, for example&quot;<em>Gen 1:1-5, 10</em>&quot;. <code>PassageTally</code> is similar but stores verses ordered by 
a tally against each verse. A <code>Strongs</code> 
represents a Greek or Hebrew word as categorized by James Strong.</p>

<h4>Passage</h4>

<p>A <code>Passage</code> is modeled 
after the JDK 2.0 <code>Collections</code> interface - so 
all the usual <code>add()</code>, <code>remove()</code> type actions are available. (A <code>PassageCollection</code> proxy class is available in order to treat a <code>Passage</code> exactly like a <code>Collection</code>)</p>

<p>In addition to this a <code>Passage</code> will do: 

<ul>
  <li>List blurring (for find X within 5 verses of Y type 
    requests)
  <li>List change notification, so you can register to 
    receive notification of changes to a <code>Passage</code>. This will be of most use with a multi-threaded search 
    engine.
  <li>An understanding of VerseRanges (see below) for 
    range counting and iteration (in addition to Verse counting etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Passage</code> interface 
uses <code>Verse</code> and <code>VerseRange</code> in many of its methods. A <code>Verse</code> is obvious - a single Bible verse e.g. &quot;<em>Exo 2:4</em>&quot;, or &quot;<em>Jude 4</em>&quot;. A <code>VerseRange</code> has a start Verse and an end Verse 
e.g. &quot;<em>Exo 3:5-7</em>&quot;, or &quot;<em>Mat 25:1-Mar 2:4</em>&quot;.</p>

<p><code>Verse</code> and <code>VerseRange</code> have a superclass interface of <code>VerseBase</code>, and this interface is collected and sorted 
by <code>Passage</code> .So an example <code>Passage</code> is &quot;<em>Exo 2:4, 3:5-7, Mat 
25:1-Mar 2:4, Jude 4</em>&quot;.</p>

<p>The <code>Passage</code> interface is 
implemented by 3 concrete classes - <code>DistinctPassage</code> is a simple sorted collection of <code>Verse</code>s, <code>RangedPassage</code> is a sorted 
collection of <code>VerseRange</code>s, and <code>BitwisePassage</code> uses an array - essentially <code>boolean[31104]</code> to specify whether a verse is a member 
of the <code>Passage</code>. Obviously each of these 
implementations has different strengths, which the user should not need to be 
bothered with. So the <code>PassageFactory</code> class is 
responsible for creating <code>Passages</code> of a suitable 
type.</p>

<h4>PassageTally</h4>

<p>The <code>PassageTally</code> class 
is-a to <code>Passage</code> however it's job is to store a 
rank to a <code>Verse</code>. This is for a best-match type 
application - &quot;find the verse that best matches these words&quot;. It is my 
intent to marry this with a Thesarus interface, because my most common gripe 
with the OLB is that I search for &quot;God &amp; loves &amp; world&quot; and 
expect to find John 3:16, but the search fails because John 3:16 uses the word 
&quot;loved&quot; and not &quot;loves&quot;.</p>

<p>The final aim is a fuzzy matching scheme to I can search 
for &quot;God loves us and gave Jesus to save us&quot; and correctly be told 
John 3:16.</p>

<h4>Strongs</h4>

<p>The <code>Strongs</code> class 
represents a Hebrew or Greek word, or a parsing number indicating the way the 
verse is aimed.</p>

<h4>Other Stuff</h4>

<p>This package has a <code>SelfTest</code> class that is designed to stress every line of code in the 
rest of the package to make it bug-free. Otherwise this package is largely 
complete. I still need to inspect [Bitwise|Distinct|Ranged]Passage and 
PassageTally </p>
